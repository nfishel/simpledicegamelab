# Simple Dice Game - üñ•Ô∏è Computer AI Lab üß†

The computer has already rolled once. After the first roll, let's say
```python
computer_roll = [4,2,1,5,3,2]
```
{% next %}

### Let's create a function that will control the computer's logic and give us back a string of choices ('r' or '-')
What will you call your function? Does it need any parameters? What will it return?

{% spolier "Hint %}
Your functions definition could look like this...
```python
def get_computer_choices(dice_list):
  pass
```
{% endspolier %}

{% next %}
